		<h1>about me</h1>
		<h5 class="iamfrom">I'm a UI Developer.</h5>
		<p class="paraabtme">I enjoy turning complex problems into simple,beautiful and intuitive interface designs.When I'm not coding or pushing pixels, you'll find me in the garden or taking pictures of the scenery.I specialise in building beautiful, responsive websites which look pixel perfect across all devices. My primary tools for achieving this are HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, with a focus on cross-browser compatibility, on-page SEO, and accessibility. I write clean, semantic, standards-based markup that’s both maintainable and efficient.But of course my job is more than just making a site look pretty. The visuals of a site are important but it’s only part of the bigger picture (pun intended). In building a website, I’m also concerned with accessibility - a site should be available to as many people as possible; usability - websites should be intuitive and easy to navigate; responsiveness - with a growing number of web enabled devices, a site should adapt to it’s surrounds; and content - a website should have a core message and communicate that message effectively. I endeavour to combine these factors in every project I work on to ensure a top quality website is delivered.</p>
